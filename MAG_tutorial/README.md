# [MAG tutorial](tutorial)

This Data Analysis Tutorial for MAG will guide you though getting hold of MAG
data from the ESA Solar Orbiter Archive (SOAR) and using that data. We will
describe the different types of MAG data products that are available on the
SOAR, and what data each of the products contain. We will also provide several
examples of how you can use MAG data products.

## User Guide
